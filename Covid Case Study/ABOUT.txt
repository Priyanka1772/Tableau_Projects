## COVID-19 Case Study using Tableau 
## Project Overview
* This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing key trends and patterns from a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset. 
* Developed as my first major Tableau project, it showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights.
