## COVID-19 Case Study using Tableau 
## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing key trends and patterns from a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset. Developed as my first major Tableau project, it showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights. A unique feature of this dashboard is the integration of a live data streaming webpage, providing up-to-date information directly within the visualization.

## Features
* Interactive Dashboards: Explore COVID-19 cases and fatalities across different regions and timeframes.
* Live Data Integration: Embedded webpage within the dashboard for real-time data streaming and analysis.
* Geographic Mapping:*Visual representation of data on maps for easy spatial analysis.
* Filterable Views: Customize data views based on specific criteria (e.g., date range, country/region).

## Technologies Used
* Tableau Desktop: For data visualization, dashboard design, and live data embedding.
* Source of Live Data: 'WorldoMeter' for the integrated live data stream.
