* Flexible Filtering: Utilized a variety of filters to enable granular data exploration by customer attributes, service details, and timeframes.
* Diverse Visualization Palette: Showcases various chart types to effectively communicate insights, including: Bar Charts, Histograms, Treemaps etc.
* Actionable Recommendations: Based on the analysis, the dashboards provide clear, data-driven recommendations aimed at reducing churn and improving customer retention strategies.
