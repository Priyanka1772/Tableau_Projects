## Deloitte Forage - Data Analysis
## Project Overview
* Recently participated in Deloitte's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to be part of the team at Deloitte.
* Created data visuals along with a home page, practiced using Tableau to represent information, and built my presentation skills in a real-world context.
