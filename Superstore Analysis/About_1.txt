## Superstore Sales Analysis (1) - Tableau Project
## Project Summary
* To uncover key insights into customer purchasing patterns, regional sales performance, and product profitability within the Superstore dataset.
* Discovered actionable insights, such as the consistent low-profit margins for the "Tables" sub-category despite high sales volume, primarily due to high shipping costs.

## Features:

* Visualizes Sales and Profit trends over time (e.g., by year, quarter, month) to identify seasonality and growth patterns.
* Explore sales performance across different regions, categories, and segments.
### Interactive Geographical Analysis:
* Sales Map: Displays geographical sales distribution and profitability across different States and Regions, allowing for quick identification of high-performing and underperforming areas.
* Users can drill down from Region to State to analyze localized performance.
