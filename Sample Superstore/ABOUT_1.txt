* Tools Used: Tableau Public for data visualization, analysis and publishing.

### Features
* Interactive Dashboards: Explore sales performance across different regions, categories, and segments.
* Custom Slicer Buttons: Implemented parameter-based slicer buttons using Tableau Actions for enhanced user interaction and dynamic filtering.
